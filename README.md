# Socrates: No Answers. Only questions.

Ever feel stuck on a problem? **Socrates** is an AI chatbot that helps you think things through and come up with great ideas. It works by using the **Socratic method**, which means it only asks questions—never gives answers. The goal is to help you find your own solutions, challenge your assumptions, and look at things in a new way.

---

## What's This All About? 🧠

In a world full of tools that just hand you answers, **Socrates does something different**: it gives you great questions.

The idea is simple: the best insights come from *you*. By questioning your own logic, you can uncover *"aha!"* moments 💡, spot flawed assumptions, and find unexpected paths forward.

## This Tool is Awesome For: 🛠️

* **Product Teams:** Got a new feature idea? Let’s poke some holes in it and make it stronger 🧪.
* **Strategists:** Want to test out a business plan? Socrates can help find the weak spots 🎯.
* **Engineers:** Trying to squash a tricky bug 🐛 or make a big code decision? A few good questions can make all the difference.
* **Basically anyone** who's staring at a tough problem and needs a fresh perspective 🔍.

## How Does It Work? 🕵️‍♂️

Socrates follows one simple but powerful rule:
**It will never give you an answer, opinion, or solution.**

Instead, it asks smart, open-ended questions to help you:

* **Get Clear:** What do you *really* mean? What are you trying to do? 🎯
* **Find Your Assumptions:** What beliefs might be holding you back? 🧱
* **Check Your Logic:** Does your argument actually make sense? 🧩
* **Think Outside the Box:** What options haven’t you considered? 🧭

Socrates acts like a curious, focused guide whose only job is to help you reach that moment of clarity 🛤️.

## Here's a Quick Example... 💬

**You:**
We need to build a new feature to get more users engaged.

**Socrates:**
What does "engaged" actually mean for you in this case?

**You:**
It means we want users to spend more time in our app.

**Socrates:**
Is more time spent the only thing that counts as good engagement, or are there other ways to measure it?

**You:**
Hmm, good point. I guess we also want them to do certain things in the app. But we figure if they spend more time, they'll just do those things anyway.

**Socrates:**
What makes you so sure that more time in the app automatically leads to them doing those specific things?
